    <h2>Let's see how border works!</h2>
    <section>

    <h2>Let's see how Padding works!</h2>
    <section>
      <div class="box7">

      <div class="box8">Padding is set to 25px. Space is created between the content and the border.<div>

    <h2>Let's see how Margin works!</h2>
    <section>
      <div class="box9">
        Margin is not set on div. Margin is 0, so it does not add space between this element and the one surrounding it.
